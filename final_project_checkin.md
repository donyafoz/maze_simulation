# Final Project Check-in 

Name: Donya Fozoonmayeh
Finalized Research Question: Can I train an agent (a hypothetical mouse) that takes a number of actions and learns to find cheese in a maze?
List of ideas to finish project in GitHub: Add deep Q-learning to project to see if it improves performance.
Working Code in GitHub: 
* Environment: gym mazes  
* An agent that learns & performs random actions in the environment: a hypothetical mouse that takes a series of actions (moving east, west, north and south) on the maze to find the ultimate reward (cheese)
