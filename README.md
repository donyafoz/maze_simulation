# Maze Simulation
I chose this project as my final project for my reinforcement learning course. 
Reinforcement learning is a machine learning technique for solving problems where there are rewards and penalties associated with each tesk. In these problems, an agent(in this case, a hypothetical mouse) operates in an environment(a maze) and learns the optimal way or the shortest route to a reward (e.g., cheese) in a given maze.
